- **[

- **[Tbtsk, or Twin 150mm Main Gun (TbtsK C/36)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_150mm_(TbtsK_C/36))**; what you use when you don't have enough Nepguns to go around, and if you have a lot of CL you won't have lots of Nepguns around; good on everyone.
- **[Belgun, or Belfast Gun](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Triple_155mm_(3rd_Year_Type))**; the favourite gun of the eponymous promiscuous maid (mostly because it's terrible on everyone else and at least until the Seattle Gun arrives) and a very sought after secondary gun for those BB/BC who can take it (+45FP is nice).
- **[Nepgun, or Neptune Gun](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Triple_152mm_Prototype_(BL_6%22_Mk_XXV))**; the premiere CL AP gun, harder better faster stronger and only slightly less accurate than the Tbtsk; also a prized commodity among those same BB/BC for similar reasons.
