Intended as a scaled-down, tier-less, early-game version of the full Tier Guide for new commanders, the listings here will focus on specific early-game concerns and only include units from W1 to W4, as that is where most newbies struggle and where most of the relevant droppable units can be found.  


## Destroyers ![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/45px-DD_img40.png "DD Icon")

![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/CassinChibi.png "Cassin Kai") ![DD](/Images-for-the-Guide/DownesChibi.png "Downes Kai")- **[USS Cassin Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Cassin#Retrofit)** **[USS Downes Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Downes#Retrofit)**

  * 60% chance to activate every 20 seconds, increase own Reload by 40% for 10 seconds (Kai)

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [General Purpose] 138.6mm; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedoes; 40mm Quad Bofors; Toolbox; Toolbox

* Post-early-game relevance:
  * High, both as a 0LB bubblewrap for cheap early-game map farming and as a MLB Kai mini-tank for Hardmode locks and later-game map farming.

>Packing a lot of Firepower for destroyers and blessed with a decent Reload buff to go along the excellent self-heal, Cassin and Downes may not have the monstrous burst damage output of their IJN counterparts but they can and will outlast them many times over while still being able to assist with AA.  
As it is for Phoenix, they are best used in mobbing fleets.


## Light Cruisers ![CL](/Images-for-the-Guide/45px-CL_img40.png "CL Icon")

![CL](/Images-for-the-Guide/LeanderKaiChibi.png "Leander Kai") - **[HMS Leander Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Leander)**
* Skill: 
  * Grant +15% Firepower to CL/CA.
  * Upon battle start and on a 30% chance every 15s, creates a smokescreen (+40% Evasion Rate while inside) for 5s.

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [General Purpose] Prototype Triple 152mm Main Gunn; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedo; 40mm Quad Bofors; Toolbox; Oxytorp
  * [Poverty] Twin 150mm tbtsk c/36; 533mm quadruple conventional torpedo; 40mm Quad Bofors; Toolbox; Toolbox

* Availability:
  * 1-4; ***2-1**, ***2-2***, 2-3, 2-4; 3-1, ***3-2***; 4-1, 4-2, 4-3

* Post-early-game relevance:
  * Average, as London Kai takes over her buffing duties while being considerably tougher and a lot more powerful. She does remain very  cheap, though, and fits snugly in those CL hardmode locks.  

* Desc: A very solid statline, a bargain basement price tag, a Firepower buff for cruisers, a smokescreen that won't accomplish much (but is better than Belfast's) and a smile to melt your heart.  
What's not to like? 

## Heavy Cruisers ![CA](/Images-for-the-Guide/45px-CL_img40.png "CA Icon")

![CA](/Images-for-the-Guide/LondonKaiChibi.png "London Kai") - **[HMS London Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/London#retrofit)**
* Skill: 
  * Increases Firepower of the entire vanguard by 15%.
  * Upon Main Gun fire, 30% chance to deal +100% damage; upon destroying an enemy unit, gain 1 stack of +1.5% Acc up to a total of 8 stacks. (Kai)
  * Once retrofitted, can mount DD guns instead of torpedoes. Efficiency stays 160%. DO THIS. (Kai)

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [General Purpose] Prototype Triple 203mm AA Gun (vs Light), Twin 203mm Main Zaragun (vs Medium), Prototype Triple 203mm Main Gun SKC (vs Heavy); 138.6mm; 40mm Quad Bofors; Research Hydraulic Gear; Toolbox
  * [Poverty] 203mm SKC (AP) or 203mm HE dual (HE); QF 120mm dual; 40mm Quad Bofors; Toolbox; Hydraulic Gear or Naval Camo

* Availability:
  * 2-1; 4-2

* Post-early-game relevance:
  * **Yes.**

* Desc:
>Stock London isn't particularly worth writing home about. Like most HMS CA she has good weaponry and a good skill bolted onto a fragile frame, and the purple CA (11 Oil) price tag is nasty... especially when Leander Kai would do most of her job for much cheaper (8 Oil).  
If you can hang on until her retrofit though, and you should, you get one of the absolute best CAs in the game - consistent, useful and powerful (in this order), London Kai augments any fleet she's in and shreds adds like few others can while enjoying okay survivability.  
![CA](/Images-for-the-Guide/PortlandKaiChibi.png "Portland Kai") - **[USS Portland Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Portland#retrofit)**
* Skill: 
  * When sortied w/ Indianapolis, gain +15% Firepower, AA and Evasion. Do not do this.
  * 25% chance every 20s, +15% damage resistance to the entire fleet for 8s. (Kai)

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [General Purpose] Prototype Triple 203mm AA Gun (vs Light), Twin 203mm Main Zaragun (vs Medium), Prototype Triple 203mm Main Gun SKC (vs Heavy); 138.6mm; 40mm Quad Bofors; Research Hydraulic Gear; Toolbox
  * [Poverty] 203mm SKC (AP) or 203mm HE dual (HE); QF 120mm dual; 40mm Quad Bofors; Toolbox; Hydraulic Gear or Naval Camo

* Availability:
  * You get her as part of the new player 'tutorial' rewards. Yay!

* Post-early-game relevance:
  * High; mainly as a boss fleet tank, since her excellent staying power and average CA damage output are a better fit for those singular long engagaments more than the several shorter ones she'd face in a mob fleet (where self-healers or heals can ensure better vanguard survivability).  
  
* Desc: 
>Exceptional HP, twice the base Evasion other CAs get once you get her the appropriate retrofit nodes, good Firepower and high AA: in a similar fashion to Cleveland, her stats alone justify her rating and the skills are just window dressing, with the Indianapolis-related buff in particular being wholly irrelevant (as her sister is way too weak to be worth consideration).    
She won't hit as often as Wichita or as hard as Chicago, but she's cheap, damn hard to kill and consistent.

![CA](/Images-for-the-Guide/ChicagoChibi.png "USS Chicago") - **[USS Chicago](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Chicago)**
* Skill: 
  * Upon firing the Main Gun, 30% chance to have it deal +100% Damage. (Has an internal cooldown of 5s; do not give her the 203Mle as the gun will reload in under 5s.)

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [General Purpose] Prototype Triple 203mm AA Gun (vs Light), Twin 203mm Main Zaragun (vs Medium), Prototype Triple 203mm Main Gun SKC (vs Heavy); 138.6mm; 40mm Quad Bofors; Research Hydraulic Gear; Toolbox
  * [Poverty] 203mm SKC (AP) or 203mm HE dual (HE); QF 120mm dual; 40mm Quad Bofors; Toolbox; Hydraulic Gear or Naval Camo

* Availability:
3-1; 4-3, 4-4

* Post-early-game relevance:
  * Average. Her DPS only gets better as better gear becomes available to you, but she'll remain very squishy; an excellent and cheap pick regardless, provided you can keep her alive (and you're not lacking in options to do that).  

* Desc: 
>The quintessential Glass Cannon, Chicago is deceptively fragile (being one of the poster girls for 'CAs not necessarily being tanks') and unassumingly devastating due to the maths involved in her skill - if she procs on her first salvo, the buff affects the second one too, meaning that that all in all her actual double damage procrate is 49%!  
Give her a decent gun and stick someone in front to take hits for her and she'll cut through the opposition like butter at a very modest 10 Oil price tag.
