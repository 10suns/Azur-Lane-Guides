Intended as a scaled-down, tier-less, early-game version of the full Tier Guide for new commanders, the listings here will focus on specific early-game concerns and only include units from W1 to W4, as that is where most newbies struggle and where most of the relevant droppable units can be found.

>Packing a lot of Firepower for destroyers and blessed with a decent Reload buff to go along the excellent self-heal, Cassin and Downes may not have the monstrous burst damage output of their IJN counterparts but they can and will outlast them many times over while still being able to assist with AA.  
As it is for Phoenix, they are best used in mobbing fleets.


## Light Cruisers ![CL](/Images-for-the-Guide/45px-CL_img40.png "CL Icon")

![CL](/Images-for-the-Guide/LeanderKaiChibi.png "Leander Kai") - **[HMS Leander Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Leander)**
* Skill: 
  * Grant +15% Firepower to CL/CA.
  * Upon battle start and on a 30% chance every 15s, creates a smokescreen (+40% Evasion Rate while inside) for 5s.

* Recommended Loadouts:
  * [General Purpose] Prototype Triple 152mm Main Gunn; 533mm quintuple conventional torpedo; 40mm Quad Bofors; Toolbox; Oxytorp
  * [Poverty] Twin 150mm tbtsk c/36; 533mm quadruple conventional torpedo; 40mm Quad Bofors; Toolbox; Toolbox

  * 1-4; ***2-1**, ***2-2***, 2-3, 2-4; 3-1, ***3-2***; 4-1, 4-2, 4-3

* Post-early-game relevance:
  * Mediocre, as London Kai takes over her buffing duties while being considerably tougher and a lot more powerful. She does remain very  cheap, though.  

* Desc: A very solid statline, a bargain basement price tag, a Firepower buff for cruisers, a smokescreen that won't accomplish much (but is better than Belfast's) and a smile to melt your heart.

>Stock London isn't particularly worth writing home about. Like most HMS CA she has good weaponry and a good skill bolted onto a fragile frame, and the purple CA (11 Oil) price tag is nasty... especially when Leander Kai would do most of her job for much cheaper (8 Oil).  
If you can hang on until her retrofit though, and you should, you get one of the absolute best CAs in the game - consistent, useful and powerful (in this order), London Kai augments any fleet she's in and shreds adds like few others can while enjoying okay survivability.
