# Your Waifu is SHIP's highly opinionated and extra-biased AL Untier Guide (WHOTUBER EDITION)

## _VERY IMPORTANT OPENING NOTE_ 
"Hey, hang on a second! Where's MY waifu? I looked at the Guides and yet she's not there!"  
Well, dear reader, barring an accidental deletion on my part I am sorry to say that she didn't make it on the Tier Guides; whether it is because she failed to meet the evaluation criteria or has proven to be entirely irrelevant outside of waifu purposes, the end result is this.  
Not to despair, though! As mentioned in the Tier Guides, even untiered units can be put to use (though they won't make it easy on you), but if you'd like to have a clearer picture of who didn't make the cut and why, here's a shortlist for it.
## _VERY IMPORTANT OPENING NOTE_ 

```
[09/12/2019]
> Natsuiro Matsuri did not join the Tier Guide, on account of her middling statline and poor skillset.
- self-buff to guns is hilariosuly ineffective given the IJN DD baseline;
- self-buff and buff to damage reduction is low impact; 
- barrage is okay but not nearly enough to offset its long charge time and not guaranteed launch.

> Murasaki Shion did not join the Tier Guide, on account of her atrocious DPS and very poor skillset. 
- damage reduction is very low-impact and suffers from the same pitfalls all screenwides debuffs do;
- barrage damage is low.
