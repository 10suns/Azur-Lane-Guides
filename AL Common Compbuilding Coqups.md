While there already is a [compbuilding guide](https://github.com/guroteske/al-guides/blob/master/Fleet%20Composition.md), courtesy of Gurosebe, it has occurred to me that many people still commit the same mistakes over and over again.  
Here is a compilation of those issues, to be expanded as they come up during my #help activities.

1. **DO NOT USE MORE THAN 1 HEALER / SELF-HEALER (unless it's W13)**  
While a 'full healing fleet' sounds like a fun meme, it isn't; the non-event self/healers you get, as sturdy as they are, are also lacking in DPS and Azur Lane is slanted significantly towards offence, not defence.  
Turtling doesn't win you games in RTS and it certainly doesn't here, as later on doing that means the backline will get blown to bits or planed to bits; offence truly is the best defence, as never forget, dead enemies deal no damage.

2. **DO NOT PUT A CARRIER AS YOUR FLAGSHIP (unless it's Zeppy or you're bringing 3 carriers anyway)
